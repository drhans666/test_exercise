## Core of Event Log REST Service

### Functionality:
- it’s possible to push new event to the top of the stream. Service
consumes events in the form of a string like “I just won a lottery
#update @all”, parses them to JSON / Object format and stores in
memory.
- it’s possible to get 10 last events from the top of the stream
- - by category (#update, #poll, #warn)
- - by person (@all, @john, @all-friends)
- - by time
